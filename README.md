# README

This repo contains the assignments I'm doing for the 2021 version of [cs124: From Languages to Information](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs124/) which covers some basic concept of natural language processing and information retrieval at the undergraduate level. The classroom recordings can be found [here on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_48v322owNVtORXuMeRmpA) and the assignments can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/cs124). 

One follow up course covers more deep learning based approaches for NLP at the graduate level which can be found [here](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/).
