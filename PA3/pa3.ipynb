    "In this assignment you will be improving upon a rather poorly-made information retrieval system. You will build an inverted index to quickly retrieve documents that match queries and then make it even better by using term-frequency inverse-document-frequency weighting and cosine similarity to compare queries to your data set. Your IR system will be evaluated for accuracy on the correct documents retrieved for different queries and the correctly computed tf-idf values and cosine similarities."

    "<b>Inverted Positional Index:</b> Implement an inverted index - a mapping from words to the documents in which they occur, as well as the positions in the documents for which they occur.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Boolean Retrieval:</b> Implement a Boolean retrieval system, in which you return the list of documents that contain all words in a query. (Yes, you only need to support conjunctions for this assignment.)\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Phrase Query Retrieval:</b> Implement a system that returns the list of documents in which the full phrase appears, (ie. the words of the query appear next to each other, in the specified order). Note that at the time of retrieval, you will not have access to the original documents anymore (the documents would be turned into bag of words), so you'll have to utilize your inverted positional index to complete this part.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>TF-IDF:</b> Compute and store the term-frequency inverse-document-frequency value for every word-document co-occurrence:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Cosine Similarity:</b> Implement cosine similarity in order to improve upon the ranked retrieval system, which currently retrieves documents based upon the Jaccard coefficient between the query and each document. Also note that when computing $w_{t, q}$ (i.e. the weight for the word ùë§ in the query) do not include the idf term. That is, $w_{t, q} = 1 + \\log_{10} \\text{tf}_{t, q}$.\n",
