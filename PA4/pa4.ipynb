The GloVe (Global Vectors) model learns vector representations for words by looking at global word-word co-occurrence statistics in a body of text and learning vectors such that their dot product is proportional to the probability of the corresponding words co-occuring in a piece of text. The GloVe model was developed right here at Stanford, and if you’re curious you can read more about it [here](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/)!"

    "You are given as input a word and a list of candidate choices. Your goal is to return the choice you think is the synonym. You’ll first implement two similarity metrics - euclidean distance and cosine similarity - then leverage them to answer the multiple choice questions!\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, you will implement the following 4 functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **euclidean_distance()**: calculate the euclidean distance between two vectors. Note: you’ll only use this metric in Part 1. For the rest of the assignment, you'll only use cosine similarity.\n",
    "* **cosine_similarity()**: calculate the cosine similarity between two vectors. You’ll be using this helper function throughout the other parts of the assignment as well, so you’ll want to get it right!\n",
    "* **find_synonym()**: given a word, a list of 4 candidate choices, and which similarity metric to use, return which word you think is the synonym! The function takes in `comparison_metric` as a parameter: if its value is `euc_dist`, you'll use Euclidean distance as the similarity metric; if its value is `cosine_sim`, you'll use cosine similarity as the metric.\n",
    "* **part1_written()**: you’ll find that finding synonyms with word embeddings works quite well, especially when using cosine similarity as the metric. However, it’s not perfect. In this function, you’ll look at a question that your `find_synonyms()` function (using cosine similarity) gets wrong, and answer why you think this might be the case. Please return your answer as a string in this function.\n",

    "# Part 3: Sentence Similarity\n",
    "For this section, your goal is to answer questions of the form:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "    True/False: the following two sentences are semantically similar:\n",
    "      1. he later learned that the incident was caused by the concorde's sonic boom\n",
    "      2. he later found out the alarming incident had been caused by concorde's powerful sonic boom\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Namely, you take in 2 sentences as input, and output either true or false (ie, a label of 1 or 0). To do this, you will create a sentence embedding that represents each sentence in vector form, then apply cosine similarity to compute the similarity between the two sentence embeddings. If they have a high enough similarity, you’ll guess \"True\" and otherwise \"False\".\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish this, you’ll first turn each sentence into a single vector embedding. There are a few different ways you can do this. For this assignment, we’ll look at two approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Simple sum**: Sum the word embeddings of each individual word in the sentence. This resulting vector is the sentence embedding vector.\n",
    "* **Sum with POS weighting**: Take a weighted sum of the individual word vectors, where the weighting depends on the part of speech (POS) of that given word. Each POS (ie, verb, noun, adjective, etc) has a different scalar weight associated with it. We multiply each word vector by the scalar weight associated with its part of speech, then sum these weighted vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, you will implement the following 2 functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **get_embedding()**: given a sentence (string), return the sentence embedding (vector). The function also takes in the parameter `use_POS`:\n",
    "    * if `use_POS` is false (regular case), leverage method 1 above - simply the sum of the word embeddings for each word in the sentence (ignoring words that don’t appear in our vocabulary).\n",
    "    * if `use_POS` is true, leverage method 2 - use a weighted sum, where we weight each word by a scalar that depends on its part of speech tag.\n",
    "* **get_similarity()**: given two sentences, find the cosine similarity between their corresponding sentence embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "Helpful hints:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We’ve given you a map `POS_weights` that maps part of speech tags to their associated weight. For example, `POS_weights['NN'] = 0.8` (where NN is the POS tag for noun).\n",
    "* You may skip words that either (1) are not in our embeddings or (2) have a POS tag that is not in `POS_weights` .\n",
    "* To get a list of all the words in the sentence, use nltk's word_tokenize function.\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  >>> sentence = \"this is a sentence\"\n",
    "  >>> word_tokens = word_tokenize(sentence)\n",
    "  >>> word_tokens\n",

To use it, you provide a list of words in a sentence, and it returns a list of tuples, where the first element is the word and the second is its corresponding POS tag. **For this PA, make sure that you pass in the entire sentence to a single call to nltk.pos_tag; do not call  nltk.pos_tag separately on each word in the sentence.** This is because some words can be multiple parts of speech (for example, \"back\" can be a noun or a verb). Passing in the entire sentence allows for more context to figure out what POS tag a word should have.\n",
